## Complex Documentation

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation. You can read more about the idea behind this design system here. You can check the components here and the foundation here.

## Bootstrap 4 Support

Blk• Design System React is built on top of the much awaited Bootstrap 4 (Reactstrap). This makes starting a new project very simple. It also provides benefits if you are already working on a Bootstrap 4 or Reactstrap project; you can just import the Blk• Design System React style over it. Most of the elements have been redesigned; but if you are using an element we have not touched, it will fall back to the Bootstrap default.
